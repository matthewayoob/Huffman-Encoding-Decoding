This program uses Huffman coding to compress and decompress files. It pulls together a plethora of coding fundamentals: recursive exploration, linked structures, trees, and streaming algorithms. In the end, this project created a fairly impressive piece of software thatâ€™s powered by a bunch of clever algorithms. This secured programming abstractions fundamentals 

It was developed incrementally
(1) Building the Huffman Tree

(2) Implementing Text Encoding and Decoding

(3) Implementing Tree Encoding and Decoding

(4) Integrate All Above Parts

(5) Rigorous Unit, Integration & Scalability Testing
