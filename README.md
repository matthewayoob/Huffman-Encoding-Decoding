Your final assignment of the quarter is to write a program that uses Huffman coding to compress and decompress files. It pulls together ideas from all over the quarter – recursive exploration, linked structures, trees, and streaming algorithms. Once you’ve finished coding this one up, you’ll have a fairly impressive piece of software that’s powered by a bunch of clever algorithms. We hope this is a fitting capstone to your experience in CS106B!
